# This scenario demonstrates basic possibilities of Random Walks
# Emulator. It runs a number of epsilon saturation experiments
# with parameters:
#   start-vertex = 0, epsilon = 0.2
#   start-vertex = 0, epsilon = 0.4
#   start-vertex = 0, epsilon = 0.6
#   start-vertex = 0, epsilon = 0.8
#   start-vertex = 1, epsilon = 0.2
#   start-vertex = 1, epsilon = 0.4
#    ...
#   start-vertex = 2, epsilon = 0.6
#   start-vertex = 2, epsilon = 0.8

rweg2gexf - Converts rweg file into gexf file.
USAGE: rweg2gexf <infile> [<outfile>]
WHERE: <infile>       - a path to the original rweg file. If does not exist,
                        this command will put the empty graph into gexf file.
       <outfile>      - (optional) a path to the gexf file where results are to be
                        saved (might not exist initially). If ommited, the file
                        will be saved with the same name as <infile> but with gexf
                        format instead of rweg.
EXAMPLES:
rweg2gexf "My graphs/Sample graph 1"          - converts the initial file called
                                                "My graphs/Sample graph 1.rweg"
                                                into a new file called
                                                "My graphs/Sample graph 1.gexf".

gexf2rweg - Converts gexf file into rweg file.
USAGE: gexf2rweg <infile> [<outfile>]
WHERE: <infile>       - a path to the original gexf file. If does not exist,
                        this command will put the empty graph into rweg file.
       <outfile>      - (optional) a path to the rweg file where results are to be
                        saved (might not exist initially). If ommited, the file
                        will be saved with the same name as <infile> but with rweg
                        format instead of gexf.
EXAMPLES:
gexf2rweg "My graphs/Sample graph 1"          - converts the initial file called
                                                "My graphs/Sample graph 1.gexf"
                                                into a new file called
                                                "My graphs/Sample graph 1.rweg".
